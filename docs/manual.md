# Mellow Art Dashboard — User Manual

A plain-language guide for running the Mellow Art platform: reviewing artist
submissions, approving/rejecting them, sending invoices through Xero, and
emailing applicants. No technical knowledge required.

- **Dashboard URL:** https://mellow-cf.mellowartmarket.workers.dev
- **Who this is for:** the admin(s) who review submissions and manage invoices.

---

## 1. What the platform does

Artists submit their profile through your public form, choosing the **event**
they're applying to (and, optionally, the **stall** they want). Each submission
lands in this dashboard as **Pending**. You review it and set a decision:

- **Accepted** → you then **assign a stall** (which sets the price) and click
  **Send invoice**: the system creates an invoice in **Xero** and emails the
  artist a link to view and pay it.
- **Waitlisted** → kept on hold; no email is sent.
- **Rejected** → the system emails the artist with the reason you wrote.

You can also track whether an invoice has been **paid** and adjust invoice
defaults (currency, account code, due date, tax).

The flow at a glance:

```
Artist submits → Pending → Accepted → assign stall → Send invoice → Xero invoice + email → track payment
                         → Waitlisted (on hold)
                         → Rejected → rejection email sent
```

> The **stall sets the price.** Each event defines its own stall options (e.g.
> Mini / Standard / Flagship), each with its own price. The assigned stall's
> price is what Xero charges — there is no single global table fee. If the
> artist already picked a stall on the form, it arrives pre-assigned (you can
> still change it before invoicing).

## 2. Logging in

1. Go to the dashboard URL and you'll be sent to the **login** page.
2. Enter your admin **email** and **password**.
3. You land on the **Dashboard** (summary cards).

> Forgot your password or need another admin account? That's done by the
> developer (admin accounts are created directly in the database). Ask them to
> reset it or add a new admin.

Use **Logout** (in the sidebar) when you're done, especially on a shared
computer.

## 3. The Dashboard (home)

After login you see summary cards:

| Card | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Total inquiries** | All submissions ever received. |
| **Pending review** | Waiting for your decision. |
| **Accepted** | Accepted applicants. |
| **Waitlisted** | Applicants kept on hold. |
| **Rejected** | Declined applicants. |

Use the sidebar to move between **Dashboard**, **Inquiries**, **Events**, and
**Invoice settings**.

---

## 4. Reviewing submissions (Inquiries)

Open **Inquiries** to see the full list (sortable, filterable, paginated).

### Columns

Each row has two **independent** status controls, plus the stall and invoice:

**Application status** (a dropdown you can change at any time):

| Status | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **Pending** | New — needs your decision. |
| **Accepted** | You accepted it. Unlocks the stall picker. |
| **Waitlisted** | On hold; no email sent. |
| **Rejected** | Declined (sends the rejection email). |

**Payment status** (separate from the decision above):

| Status | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **Not sent** | No invoice created yet. |
| **Invoicing** | Invoice is being created in Xero. |
| **Awaiting payment** | Invoice sent, not yet paid. |
| **Paid** | Invoice paid. |
| **Overdue** | Invoice past its due date. |
| **Voided** | Invoice cancelled. |

Other columns: **Stall assigned** (dropdown, only active once Accepted),
**Invoice** (the *Send invoice* button / link), and a **Notes** icon (see
below). You can **filter by Application status, Payment status, or Event** and
search by name/email to focus your work.

### Viewing details

Click a row's actions and choose **View** to see the artist's full profile —
bio, contact details, and their uploaded **profile photo + portfolio images**.
(Images are private; only logged-in admins can see them.)

### Accepting and invoicing

This is a few steps, because the **stall** (and therefore the price) is chosen
before the invoice:

1. Set the row's **Application status** to **Accepted**.
2. In the **Stall assigned** column, pick a stall. The options are this event's
   configured stalls, each with its price. (If the artist already chose a stall
   on the form, it's already filled in — change it here if needed.)
3. Click **Send invoice** in the **Invoice** column. The system:
   - Creates an **invoice in Xero** for the **stall's price**, using your other
     Invoice settings (currency, account code, tax, due date).
   - **Emails the artist** an approval message with a "View & pay invoice" link.
4. Payment status moves to **Awaiting payment**.

> **Send invoice** only appears once a row is **Accepted with a stall assigned**.
> If an event has no stalls yet, the stall column links you to **Events** to add
> them.

**Requirements for invoicing to fully work:**
- **Xero must be connected** (otherwise the invoice can't be created).
- **Gmail must be connected** for the email to send. If Gmail is disconnected,
  the invoice still happens — only the email is skipped.

### Waitlisting / Rejecting

- Set **Application status** to **Waitlisted** to keep an applicant on hold (no
  email is sent).
- Set it to **Rejected** and **type a reason** (required) — the reason is
  included in the email sent to the artist. The rejection email is best-effort:
  if Gmail is disconnected or fails, the rejection is still recorded.

> You can change the Application status at any time via the dropdown. Re-setting
> a row to **Rejected** re-sends the rejection email.

### Internal notes

Each row has a **sticky-note icon** (between Payment and the actions menu). Click
it to add or edit **private staff notes** about an applicant — reminders,
follow-ups, anything internal. The icon is filled when notes exist. These notes
are **never shown to the applicant** and are separate from the "additional
notes" the artist may have written on the form (which appear in their profile).

### Tracking payment

The system doesn't automatically know when an invoice is paid in Xero, so you
reconcile it by hand:

1. Check the invoice status in your **Xero** account.
2. Back in the dashboard, open the row's actions → **Payment**, and set the
   matching status: **Awaiting payment**, **Paid**, **Overdue**, or **Voided**.

This keeps the dashboard badge in sync with reality.

## 5. Invoice settings

Open **Invoice settings** in the sidebar. This page has three sections.

### Xero connection

Invoices can only be created while Xero is **Connected**.

- **Connect Xero** → opens Xero's consent screen → returns here showing
  "Connected · <your organisation>".
- **Reconnect** → re-authorize (e.g. after the connection expires).
- **Disconnect** → stops invoice creation until reconnected.

> The connection refreshes itself automatically while in use. If it sits unused
> for ~60 days it expires and you'll need to **Reconnect**.

### Email (Gmail)

Sends approval and rejection emails from your Google Workspace mailbox.

- **Connect Gmail** → opens Google's consent screen → returns showing
  "Connected · <mailbox>". That mailbox becomes the **From** address on all
  emails.
- **Reconnect** / **Disconnect** as needed.

> Approvals and rejections still work while Gmail is disconnected — the emails
> are simply not sent.

### Line item & tax

These defaults are applied to the single fee line on every generated invoice.
Note there is **no price field here** — the price comes from the **stall**
assigned to each applicant (configured per event under **Events**).

| Field | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| **Item description** | Text shown on the invoice line (e.g. "Full table fee"). The assigned stall's tier name is appended automatically. |
| **Currency** | 3-letter code, e.g. `AUD`, `USD`. Used only as a fallback if a stall has no currency. |
| **Account code** | Your Xero account/ledger code the income posts to. |
| **Due in (days)** | How many days from issue until the invoice is due. |
| **Line amount types** | Whether the stall price is tax-inclusive, exclusive, or no-tax (matches Xero's options). |
| **Tax type** | Xero tax code, chosen from a dropdown: **GST on Income (10%)**, **GST Free Income**, or **No GST**. |

Click **Save settings**. Changes apply to **future** invoices only — already-
created invoices are not changed.

## 6. Where the artist form sends data

Artists don't use this dashboard — they fill in your public form, which sends
their submission to the platform automatically. The form also tells the platform
which **event** the artist is applying to, and optionally which **stall** they
picked, so submissions arrive already scoped (and sometimes pre-assigned a
stall). The technical details of that connection (the API) are in
`docs/api-submit.md` (for whoever builds/maintains the form). As the admin, you
only ever see the results in **Inquiries**.

---

## 7. Common questions

**An artist says they didn't get the email.**
Check **Invoice settings → Email (Gmail)** shows *Connected*. If it was
disconnected at the time, the email was skipped — reconnect, then (for
approvals) the invoice link is also visible in Xero so you can resend manually.

**Invoice failed / no invoice was created.**
Check **Invoice settings → Xero connection** shows *Connected*, that the row is
**Accepted with a stall assigned**, then click **Send invoice** again.

**The Send invoice button isn't showing.**
A row must be **Accepted** *and* have a **stall assigned** first. If the stall
column says the event has no stalls, add them under **Events** for that event.

**I set the wrong decision.**
Application status can be changed anytime from its dropdown. For an invoice
mistake, void/correct it in Xero and set the dashboard **Payment** status to
**Voided**. For other fixes, contact the developer.

**Can I change the email wording?**
The email text is set in the app's templates. Ask the developer to adjust the
approval/rejection wording.

**Who can log in?**
Only admin accounts created by the developer. There's no public sign-up.
